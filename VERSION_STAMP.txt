🛡️ SHIELD-RYZEN: AGENT-ENGINEER "EXTREME" ARCHITECTURE DEEP DIVE
This is a master-level technical decomposition of the Shield-Ryzen V2.3.1 "Precision" Architecture.

I. The Core Engine: Async Triple-Buffer Pipeline
Unlike standard sequential AI scripts (Capture → Process → Show), Shield-Ryzen uses a Parallel Execution Pipeline to eliminate "Input Lag" and maximize Ryzen AI NPU utilization.

Buffer A (The Eyes): A dedicated ShieldCamera thread capturing raw frames via DirectShow at 30-60 FPS.
Buffer B (The Brain): The 
ShieldEngine
 running the Neural + Forensic + Physics logic in parallel. It uses 
IdentityTracker
 (IOU-based) to ensure that UID-0 on frame 1 is the same UID-0 on frame 1000.
Buffer C (The Voice): The ShieldHUD rendering the GFX layer using alpha-blending, ensuring the UI 10 FPS does not slow down the camera's 30 FPS.
II. Tiered Forensic Defense (The 3-Tier Security Stack)
Shield-Ryzen does not just "ask" the AI if a face is real. It performs a Cross-Metric Interrogation:

Tier 1: Neural Probabilistic (Deepfake Detection)
Model: XceptionNet (FaceForensics++ weights), quantized to INT8.
Math: calibrated_probs = softmax(logits / Temperature).
Engineering Fix: We use T=2.0 (Temperature Scaling) to force the model to be more "doubtful." This makes it easier to catch the subtle "Fake" spikes in AI videos.
Tier 2: Liveness Photonic (Blink & Response)
Trigger: MediaPipe 478-point Landmarker.
Metric: EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio). If the user doesn't blink within a 1.5s grace period, the state demotes to FAIL.
Persistence: A face must display a natural "High-to-Low-to-High" EAR curve before it is promoted to VERIFIED.
Tier 3: Physical Ground-Truth (The Screen Shield)
This is where we catch "Replay Attacks" using pure physics:

The Problem: High-resolution phone screens look "Too Sharp" to an AI.
The Formula: We use the Inverse Square Law of Texture Resolution.
$MaxTexture = 700 \times (50/Distance)^2 \times 4$
If a face at 100cm has the sharpness of a face at 30cm, it is mathematically impossible for it to be human skin — it must be a 4K phone screen.
III. The State-Machine & Lockout Logic (V2.3.1 Precision)
This is the "Brain's Memory" that prevents hackers from tricking the system.

Rolling Window Consensus: We track the last 60 frames for every face.
Percentage-Based Lockout: If 
(Sum of FAKE Frames / 60) > 0.50
, the identity is placed in FAKE Lockout.
Neural Trace (The Scorch Mask): If the neural confidence ever hits < 0.20, that face ID is "Poisoned." Even if they look real later, the system remembers the deepfake signature and blocks VERIFIED status.
IV. Module Calibration Matrix (V2.3.1)
Parameter	Value	Technical Rationale
Ref_Texture	700.0	Calibrated to real human skin resolution at 50cm.
Abs_Cap	1500.0	The upper limit for human skin; anything higher is a pixel grid.
Safety_Margin	4.0x	Allows for extreme lighting variance/HDR while catching screens.
Moire_Thresh	0.50	Filtered to ignore skin pores but catch digital grid interference.
Fusion_Min	3.0	Requires 3 separate forensic failures before a physical lockout.
